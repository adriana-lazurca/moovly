# Moovly Project

 The project is a mini single page app (SPA) containing as main page the sign up page and two other placeholder pages.
 
 ### Technologies:
 
* __ReactJS__
* __React Router__ for the navigation
* __Formik__ and __Yup__ for form creation and validation
* __Json-server__ for mocking the back-end
* __Axios__ for for calling back-end APIs
* __Bootstrap__ for styling
* __Concurrently__ for running front-end and back-end in parallel

### State management

To persist user state through a page refresh, I used local storage, with the help of a [hook](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage).
